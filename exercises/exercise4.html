    <h1>Exercise 4: Images</h1>
    <p>
      For this exercise, I chose three images of nature that I like: a bird photo, an elk photo, and a beach photo I took myself.
    </p>

    <h2>1) Bird</h2>
    <p>
      I picked this photo because the bird is cute and chubby, and I love the green background.
    </p>

    <h2>2) Elk</h2>
    <p>
      I chose this one because elk are magestic creatures and the forest background is really pretty.
    </p>

    <h2>3) Beach (my photo)</h2>
    <p>
      This is a photo I took myself on a family trip to Nova Scotia. I like it because it feels soothing to remember when I had no responsibilities.
