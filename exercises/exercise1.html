    <h1>Meet Cole Hartford</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I’m a senior at UMass Amherst studying Managerial Economics with a minor in Information Technology.
        I’m especially interested in transportation and municipal planning, and I like using tools such
        as Excel, data analysis, and GIS to better understand how communities work.

    <h2>My Story</h2>

    <p>
        Throughout my time at UMass Amherst, I've become interested in how economic analysis and technology can
        be applied to real problems, especially in public and municipal settings. Through my classes
        and internships, I’ve had the chance to work on projects related to transportation planning and
        local government.
    </p>

    <p>
        I enjoy working with others and have liked collaborating with town staff, community members,
        and classmates on projects that have practical, real-world outcomes. These experiences have
        helped shape my interest in planning-related and public-sector careers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of school, I enjoy golfing, skateboarding, fitness, and spending time with friends and family. I also like to travel and explore new places.
